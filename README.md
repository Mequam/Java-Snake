Java Snake
a simple javascript snake game using an html5 canvas
---------------
usage:
	any webrowser with decent javascript support can be pointed
	at the file to run the program

rules:
	move your snake around with the number pad or the arrow keys!

	
	be carefull, the more you eat the more your score will go up but the
	
	larger youll grow. Don't run into yourself or its game over

	
	Somtimes you might find a spicy food on the ground, if you eat it
	
	you will get x2 length and points until it wears off, but you will
	
	also go twice as fast!
